This example is meant to show how to transpile your own custom es6 GraphiQL implementation with webpack and babel configs.

There is also a noconfig example with CRA:

Thus it appears that create react app honors all of the same language features that we have.

### Setup

1. `yarn` and `yarn build` at the monorepo ROOT.
2. `yarn start` to start webpack dev server
